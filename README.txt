Are you stuck on some particular level in "Guess the Movie- Bollywood" Game ?

Use this tool to find out movies you are not sure of. Provide year, words and the number of letters in each word. The script will return the match based on your input.
As far as I have tried, the code works about 80-90% of the time.

Note: It searches from wikipedia page, as a result only those movies present in wikipedia page will be returned.

For those who do not have python, download the zip file, extract and click/run the findBollywood.exe file present inside findBollywood_exe folder. 

Sample:

enter the year: 1992
enter no of words: 2
input no of letters in each word separated by comma: 5,4
Year: 1992
No of Words: 2
No of Letters: 5,4
['Lambu Dada']

do you want to continue: y/n: n

Have fun :)
